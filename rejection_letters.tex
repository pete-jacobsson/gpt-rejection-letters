This project is about using GPT to write meaningful job rejection
letters. The idea for the project came from an automated response from
an application I did some time ago. The message was nice, and it was
nice to receive something - but the thing that struck me was that they
apologized for the reply being impersonal. So I thought - \textbf{Hey,
it should be possible to not only personalize, but also build feedback
into the reply}. With a connection to GPT the ATS might start working
for both sides.

\hypertarget{tldr}{%
\subsection{TLDR}\label{tldr}}

We have an (AI-generated) job description, an (AI-generated) CV. We run
a function and we receive a rejection letter that specifies how the
candidate might need to work on to improve their chances next time
round. Integrated into a data workflow this would improve the engagement
with prospective candidates (thus building a better talent pool for
future hires), hopefully lead to improvement in candidate quality over
time, and would add only a very limited cost to the operation of a
recruiting system (limited to some processing power and covering GPT
costs).

Hence, we built ourselves a fictionalized job description. A little not
on the prompt. I wanted to have a specific enough description to
generate discrepencies from a random GPT-generated CV (which we will do
in the next section). I also wanted the description to not be too long
(mostly for my own sake - I don't feel like reading a 2,000 word
fictitious job description). Last, on the first iteration, I didn't like
the requirements section enough - they were a little ``wooly'' - not
something that a traditional ATS could easily detect by scanning for
keywords. Hence, I added the section asking GPT to return a specific
skill list for the requirements.

\hypertarget{how-does-it-work-generate-a-sample-cv}{%
\subsection{How does it work? Generate a sample
CV}\label{how-does-it-work-generate-a-sample-cv}}

Again, I will rely on GPT for this. The original job description is one
for a data analyst in a logistics sector. John Doe, our fictional
rejectee will hold a Masters in economics and will have had three years
experience as a data analyst in the retail sector. What Herbert will
lack on his CV is evidence of knowledge of logistics, nothing on Excel,
no programming languages. He will specify that he is a certified Scrum
Master, but not mention project management explicitly. I might then
throw in some additional curve balls into the prompt to get some more
controlled clashes with the job description.

Dear John,

Thank you for applying for the Junior Data Analyst position in the Logistics Sector. We appreciate your interest in our company. While your CV is impressive, we regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you an interview at this time.

The requirements for the position include a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or related field, with proficiency in SQL and Excel. The position also requires experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI, programming languages such as Python or R, and knowledge of logistics operations and supply chain management. Experience with project management methodologies such as Agile or Waterfall is also desired.

While your Master's degree in Economics and experience as a Data Analyst in the retail sector demonstrate your strong analytical skills, your CV does not provide evidence of proficiency in SQL or Excel. In addition, the job description requires experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI, which are not listed on your CV. Although you have programming experience in Python, R, and SQL, knowledge of logistics operations and supply chain management is not evident in your experience.

We encourage you to continue to develop your skills and experience in the areas mentioned above to increase your chances of success in future applications. We wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Kind Regards,

George, Automated HR assistant.

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in the Junior Data Analyst position for the logistics sector. We appreciate the time and effort you put into submitting your CV. Unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your application at this time.

After comparing your CV to the job description, we found that you possess many of the required skills, such as statistical analysis, data modeling, and data visualization. However, we noticed that you did not mention any experience with logistics operations or supply chain management, which is a key requirement for this position. Additionally, while you have experience with Scrum, you did not mention experience with Agile or Waterfall project management methodologies.

We encourage you to continue developing your skills in these areas and to consider gaining experience in logistics operations and supply chain management. This will increase your chances of being considered for similar positions in the future.

Thank you again for your interest in our company, and we wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Best regards,

George, Automated HR assistant
