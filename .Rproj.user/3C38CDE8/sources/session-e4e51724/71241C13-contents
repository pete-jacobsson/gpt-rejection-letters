This project is about using GPT to write meaningful job rejection letters. The idea for the project came from an automated response from an application I did some time ago. The message was nice, and it was nice to receive something - but the thing that struck me was that they apologized for the reply being impersonal. So I thought - **Hey, it should be possible to not only personalize, but also build feedback into the reply**. With a connection to GPT the ATS might start working for both sides.


## Set up

I set up the GPT connection via the API, as discussed by Isa Fulford and Andrew NG in their deeplearning.ai course.

```{python}
import openai
import os

with open('/home/pete/Documents/gpt_key.txt') as t:
  token = t.readlines()


```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
