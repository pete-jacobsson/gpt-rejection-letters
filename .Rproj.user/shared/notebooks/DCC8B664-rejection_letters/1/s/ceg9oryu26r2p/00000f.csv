"1","Dear John,

Thank you for your recent application for the Junior Data Analyst position in the logistics sector. We appreciate your interest in the role and the time you took to apply. Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that your application was unsuccessful on this occasion.

After carefully reviewing your CV against the job description, we found that your skills and experience did not match all the requirements for the position. While you have a strong background in data analysis and statistical modeling, there were a few areas where we felt you did not meet the requirements. Specifically, you did not have experience with logistics operations and supply chain management, which is a key requirement for this position. Additionally, you did not mention any experience with Excel, which is a required skill for this role.

We encourage you to continue to develop your skills and experience in these areas, as they will be valuable for future roles in the logistics sector. You may also want to consider taking courses or certifications to improve your knowledge of logistics operations and Excel.

We appreciate your interest in our organization and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Sincerely,

George, Automated HR assistant
