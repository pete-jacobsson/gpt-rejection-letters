This project is about using GPT to write meaningful job rejection letters. The idea for the project came from an automated response from an application I did some time ago. The message was nice, and it was nice to receive something - but the thing that struck me was that they apologized for the reply being impersonal. So I thought - **Hey, it should be possible to not only personalize, but also build feedback into the reply**


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
