This project is about using GPT to write meaningful job rejection letters. The idea for the project came from an automated response from an application I did some time ago. The message was nice, and it was nice to receive something - but the thing that struck me was that they apologized for the reply being impersonal. So I thought - **Hey, it should be possible to not only personalize, but also build feedback into the reply**. With a connection to GPT the ATS might start working for both sides.


## Set up

I set up the GPT connection via the API using  the get_completion function, as discussed by Isa Fulford and Andrew NG in their deeplearning.ai course.

```{python}
import openai
import os

with open('/home/pete/Documents/gpt_key.txt') as t:
  openai.api_key = t.readlines()


def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

```

Lets test if the function works

```{python}
prompt = f"""Are there any hurricanes in Hampshire today?"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
